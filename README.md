## Installation

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Download the `client.lua` and `server.lua` files from this repository.

     CREATE TABLE `jailed_players` (
         `license` VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,    -- Unique identifier for the player's license
         `playerName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- Name of the jailed player
         `timeRemaining` INT NOT NULL,          -- Time remaining in jail in seconds
         `reason` VARCHAR(255)                  -- Reason for jailing
     ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

     -- Optional: Add an index for faster lookups on the license
     CREATE INDEX `idx_license` ON `jailed_players` (`license`);
     ```

4. **Configure Discord Webhook**:
   - Replace the `discordWebhook` variable in `server.lua` with your Discord webhook URL.

You can customize the jail locations by editing the `jailLocations` table in `client.lua`. Add or remove coordinates as needed.

### Release Location
The release location is set in the `releaseCoords` variable in `client.lua`. Update this to your desired release point.

### Escape Range
The `escapeRange` variable in `client.lua` determines how far a player can go from their jail location before being teleported back. Adjust this value as needed.
